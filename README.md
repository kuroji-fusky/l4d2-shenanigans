# Heck mods for Left 4 Dead 2

Some funnies or just to kill some time with the help of scripts lol

It also includes a Python script that automates manual extraction for certain
add-ons, such as [this one](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2818315524),
it'll create a backup of an existing mods - if any - so it'll be safe to
rollback if the script I wrote isn't skill issue

Most of the instructions to use GCFScape, but [VPKEdit](https://github.com/craftablescience/VPKEdit)
is a more suitable choice as GCFScape only includes a GUI and is something
you can't tamper with code.
